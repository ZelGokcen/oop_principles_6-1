Class vs Object
-Class can be created <class> keyword
-Class is something that we can create mant Object from.
-Class is a blueprint-template while object is an instance of a class.

Object: instance of a class

NOTE: We can create unlimited numbers of objects (instances) from a class.

SYNTAX:
class MathHelper{
	
}

MathHelper mh = new MathHelper(); // Instance or Object


-Java classes -> Scanner, String, Wrappers, Arrays, ArrayList, Random

class String{
	//many members
}


String name = "John";
String address = "Chicago";


-class members:
		constructor: allows us to create objects
		methods: behaviors 
		instance variables - fields - states - attributes
		blocks



class: House

public class House{
	//instance variables
	String color;
	int year;
	String address;
	double price;
}


// House{color='null', year='0', address='null', price='0.0'}

House house1 = new House(); 
house1.color = "Purple";
house1.year = 1990;
house1.address = "Chicago";
house1.price = 300000;

// House{color='purple', year='1990', address='null', price='300000.0'}


DEFAULT VALUES:
Objects 	-> null
int 		-> 0
boolean 	-> false
double 		-> 0.0


CAN WE UPDATE THE DEFAULT VALUES FOR INSTANCE VARIABLES?
color not null but White



What does a house have?
Each house should have below information, and it will be different for each house.

color 	-> String
year 	-> int
address -> String
price 	-> double
numberOfRooms 	-> int
largeWindows 	-> boolean
hasGarden		-> boolean
parkingLot 		-> int
sqft 			-> int 




WHY DO WE OVERRIDE toString() method?
-When you have a template class and create objects from it, you will get object memory address if you print it.
-HOWEVER, if you would like to see object instance variables values, then you need to override toString() method
	1. Right click in proper line in your template class
	2. Select Generate option
	3. Select toString() option
	4. Select all the instance variables from the window
	5. Click OK



//Creating a new Object
-We use <new> keyword to create an object
-<new> keyword always used together with a constructor to create an object
-constructor is a special method used to instantiate an object of a class
-constructor always has the same name as the class
-Java always provide a default constructor when you create a class (hidden)
-Once you create a custom constructor (overloaded constructor), Java will not provide the default one anymore. If you need it, then you need to explicitly create it

DIFFERENCES OF METHODS AND CONSTRUCTOR
-Method can be static while constructor cannot
-Method can be void or return while constructor cannot

SIMILARITIES
-both can take arguments
-both overloaded



Zero argument 		-> no information
House h1 = new House();

Five arguments 		-> All the five info
House h2 = new House("Brown", 123000, 2023, "Miami", true);



If I want to create House object only with price and year information
-I need to create 2 args constructors - price and year
