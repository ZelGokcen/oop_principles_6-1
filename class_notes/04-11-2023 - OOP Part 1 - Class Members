RECAP:

OOP: Object-Oriented Programming

putting all the real life objects into programming

class: blueprint that allows us to create instances
object: instance of a class

Class members:
	1. constructor: it is special method used to instantiate objects
	2. instance variables - fields: defining object characteristics
	3. methods: functions of the object
	4. blocks: help us to run a block before object getting created


What student has?	-> instance variables
What student does? 	-> method

public class Student{
	
	//This is our default constructor
	public Student(){

	}


	//Overloading constructor
	public Student(String fullName, int age){
		this.fullName = fullName;
		this.age = age;
	}


	//Instance variables
	String fullName;
	int age;
	static final String course = "Software Engineer in Test";


	//Methods
	public void study(){

	}

	public int getAge(){
		return this.age;
	}


	public static String getCourse(){
		return course;
	}

}



CREATING MANY OBJECTS
Student s1 = new Student("John Doe", 45);
Student s2 = new Student("Jane Doe", 45);
Student s3 = new Student("Alex Smith", 25);
Student s4 = new Student("Jessie Morgan", 18);



System.out.println(s1.fullName); // John Doe

s1.getAge(); // 45
s2.getAge(); // 45

System.out.println(Student.course);

Local variable vs Instance variable
Instance variable: these are class level and defines the object's features
Local variable: these are the ones used in any block like if-else-switch-method and so on.


this keyword: it refers to the current object



static method: belongs to class and can be invoked with the class name
non-static method: belongs to object and can be invoked with an object


static instance variables: when one instance variables can be accepted for all the objects, it makes sense to have it as a static variable. In this case, it will be a class information and can be invoked with the class name.


final instance variables: this means instance variable value is given and no one can change it in their programs.



static instance variable or method: accessing members with className or object
final instance variables: being able to change the value or not


class String{
	members
}


String.toLowerCase(); // compliler error because toLowerCase() method is non-static


String name = "John";

name.toLowerCase();

4 bytes -> large number

Integer.MAX_VALUE = 5; // compiler error because MAX_VALUE is a final variable



CONSTRUCTOR:
-it is the class member allowing to create objects
-You will be provided a default contructor once you create the object and it is hidden by defualt
-It looks like method but it cannot void or return type
-We can overload constructor with arguments just like methods
-Constructor can never be final 
-Constructor can never be static
-Constructor name should always be same as the class name


class Teacher{

	public Teacher(){

	}


}



2 classes may have relationship
Student 	Teacher
Author 		Book 			HAS A RELATIONSHIP
Person 		Country


Dog Huskey
Car GermanCar 		IS A RELATIONSHIP
Animal Cat





class Country{
	String name;
	int population;
}



BLOCKS
instance block: is used to run a block of code for each object being created
{
	
}


***
static block: is used to run a block of code even before main method or any other code. It runs only once.

static {
	
}
